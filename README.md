# LibDetailSearcher

Really simple example of Libraries.io api.
To use, create one folder on top ** "license.json" ** with the following content:

```

{"license":"<api key from libraries.io>"}

```

I'll keep enhancing this. Right now it has the option to output the lib details to a file. This helped me to measure the amount of dependencies a group of libs had in order to determine mantainability of an application.
